        <h2 class="page-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">How accurate is the data?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our data is based on extensive research of public real estate listings, job portals, and economic reports for each city tier. It is intended to be a strong, realistic estimate for planning purposes. However, market prices can change quickly. We strongly recommend using our report as a baseline and then getting current, local quotes for your final business plan.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Can I use this report for a bank loan application?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>You can use this report as an excellent starting point and a foundation for your financial projections. However, for a bank loan, you will need to expand on this with a more detailed business plan, including your own local research, supplier quotes, marketing strategy, and revenue projections.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Why did the calculator say my budget was too low?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our system first allocates money for one year of essential recurring costs: rent and salaries. If your total budget isn't enough to cover these core expenses, there would be no money left for equipment, marketing, or legal fees, making the business unviable from the start. This check is in place to provide a realistic financial picture.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Are you planning to add more states or business types?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, absolutely! Our vision is to expand across all of India and to continuously add more niche business models. We are constantly working on gathering new data. If you have a specific request, please let us know via our contact channels!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
         <!-- Question 5 -->
         <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">How does BzPlanzo make money if it's free?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our primary goal is to provide a valuable free tool. To support the operational costs of the website (like hosting, development, and data research), we use Google AdSense to display advertisements. This allows us to keep the service free for all users.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW Question 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">What is 'Breakeven Point' and why is it important?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The breakeven point is the moment your business's total revenue equals its total expenses. You haven't made a profit yet, but you're no longer losing money. Our report estimates the time to breakeven in months, which is a critical metric for understanding how long you'll need to operate before your venture becomes self-sustaining.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW Question 7 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Do the salary estimates include costs like PF and taxes?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. The salary figures in our report represent the estimated gross monthly salary (in-hand pay plus deductions) for an employee. They do not include the employer's additional contributions like PF (Provident Fund), ESI (Employees' State Insurance), or other business taxes. You should budget for these as extra operational costs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW Question 8 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Why is the 'Equipment' percentage so different for a Gym vs. a Digital Agency?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our model allocates your one-time setup costs based on the nature of the business. A gym is 'capital-intensive', meaning it requires a huge upfront investment in physical equipment. A digital marketing agency, however, is 'service-based', where the main assets are computers and software, resulting in a much lower initial equipment cost.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW Question 9 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Can I adjust the profit margin used in the calculations?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Currently, the profit margin is a fixed, industry-standard estimate to provide a consistent baseline. The feature to edit this is on our development roadmap. For now, you can use our breakeven revenue target and apply your own custom profit margin to it manually to see how it affects your financial goals.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW Question 10 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">The report mentions 'Misc' costs. What does this include?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>'Misc' (Miscellaneous) is a crucial buffer fund for unexpected one-time expenses during setup. This can include anything from utility security deposits, small repairs to the rented space, office supplies, or software licenses that don't fall under major equipment. It's the "just in case" fund that every new business needs.</p>
